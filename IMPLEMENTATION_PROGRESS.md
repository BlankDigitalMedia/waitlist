# Thank You Email Implementation Progress

## Overview
We're implementing automated thank you emails for the Blank Survey waitlist using Convex Resend component and React Email, following the plan in `THANK_YOU_EMAIL_PLAN.md`.

## What We've Accomplished âœ…

### 1. Dependencies Installed
- âœ… `@convex-dev/resend` - Convex Resend component
- âœ… `react-email` - React Email framework
- âœ… `@react-email/components` - Pre-built email components
- âœ… `@react-email/render` - Converts React components to HTML

### 2. Convex Configuration
- âœ… Created `convex.config.ts` to register the Resend component with Convex
- âœ… Used `defineApp()` and `app.use(resend)` pattern
- âœ… Convex development environment running successfully

### 3. Email Template Created
- âœ… Created `convex/emails/ThankYouEmail.tsx` with:
  - Professional branded design
  - Personalization with user name
  - Waitlist position display
  - Company information and next steps
  - Responsive styling using inline CSS

### 4. Email Service Setup
- âœ… Created `convex/emails.ts` with email sending functions
- âœ… **RESOLVED**: TypeScript compilation errors fixed
- âœ… Proper Resend component initialization
- âœ… Event type handling for webhook callbacks
- âœ… Type-safe email event processing

### 5. Waitlist Integration
- âœ… Updated `convex/waitlist.ts` to automatically send thank you emails
- âœ… Integrated position calculation for personalized emails
- âœ… Error handling to ensure waitlist signup succeeds even if email fails

### 6. Development Environment
- âœ… Convex dev server running successfully
- âœ… Next.js development server running on port 3003
- âœ… Created `.env.example` with required environment variables

## Next Steps ðŸš€

1. **Set up Resend API key** in environment variables
2. **Configure domain verification** in Resend (for production emails)
3. **Test email sending** with real Resend account
4. **Set up webhook endpoint** for email status tracking (optional)
5. **Deploy to production** and verify email functionality

## Setup Instructions for Email Functionality

### 1. Get Resend API Key
1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com) and create an account
2. Navigate to API Keys section
3. Generate a new API key
4. Copy the key (starts with `re_`)

### 2. Set Environment Variables
Choose one of these methods:

**Option A: Using Convex CLI (Recommended)**
```bash
npx convex env set RESEND_API_KEY your_api_key_here
```

**Option B: Using .env.local**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Update Email Domain (Production)
In `convex/emails.ts`, update the `from` field:
```typescript
from: "Blank Survey <hello@yourdomain.com>"
```

### 4. Test the Functionality
1. Start the development servers (both should be running)
2. Go to http://localhost:3003
3. Sign up for the waitlist
4. Check your email for the thank you message

## Current Status: âœ… READY FOR TESTING

The email system is now implemented and ready for testing. All TypeScript errors have been resolved, and the integration between the waitlist signup and email sending is complete.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `convex.config.ts` - Convex app configuration
- `convex/emails/ThankYouEmail.tsx` - React email template
- `convex/emails.ts` - Email sending logic (needs fixes)

### Files to Modify
- `convex/waitlist.ts` - Add email trigger to `addToWaitlist` mutation
- Environment variables - Add `RESEND_API_KEY`

## Architecture

```
User submits form â†’ addToWaitlist mutation â†’ sendThankYouEmail â†’ Resend API â†’ User receives email
                                         â†“
                                   Email events â†’ handleEmailEvent â†’ Log/store status
```

## Email Template Features
- Clean, professional design
- Personalized greeting with user name
- Waitlist position information
- Company branding and messaging
- Mobile-responsive styling
- Footer with support information

## Status
**ðŸ”§ In Progress**: Resolving TypeScript compilation issues before proceeding with integration and testing.
